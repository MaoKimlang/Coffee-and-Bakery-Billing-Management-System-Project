Coffee and Bakery Billing Management System

The project is inspired by my database course, 
I'm the coffee lover who wants to create a coffee and bakery management system.
The system you want to build is focused on the cashier functionality, 
without including other components like inventory management or customer-facing features.

The goal is to create a practical and efficient cashier system for a coffee shop,
leveraging the MySQL database for data storage and the Flask web framework for the application logic and user interface.

If you want to run those files you need to save it in a folder,
then activate enviroment venv(window) ".venv\Scripts\activate",
next you need to run requirment.txt and finally run the app.py.
